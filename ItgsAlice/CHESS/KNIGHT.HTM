<H3>Knight</H3>

<P>The knight makes a move that consists of first one step in a horizontal
or vertical direction, and then one step diagonally. The knight <I>jumps</I>:
it is allowed that the first square that the knight passes over is occupied
by an arbitrary piece. For instance, white can start the game by moving
his knight from b1 to c3. The piece that is jumped over is further not
affected by the knight: as usual, a knight takes a piece of the opponent
by moving to the square that contains that piece. </P>
