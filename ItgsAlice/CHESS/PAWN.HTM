<H3>Pawn</H3>

<P>The pawn moves differently regarding whether it moves to an empty square
or whether it takes a piece of the opponent. When a pawn does not take,
it moves one square straight forward. When this pawn has not moved at all,
i.e., the pawn is still at the second row (from the owning players view),
the pawn may make a double step straight forward. For instance, a white
pawn on d2 can be moved to d4. </P>

<P>When taking, the pawn goes one square diagonally forward. </P>

</P></CENTER>

<P>There is one special rule, called <I>taking en-passant</I>. When a pawn
makes a double step from the second row to the fourth row, and there is
an enemy pawn on an adjacent square on the fourth row, then this enemy
pawn may move to the square on the third row that was passed over, and
taking the other pawn. This taking en-passant must be done directly: if
the player who could take en-passant does not do this in the first move
after the double step, this pawn cannot be taken anymore by an en-passant
move. </P>

A double pawn step, and a following en-passant capture </P></CENTER>

<P>Pawns that reach the last row of the board <I>promote.</I> When a player
moves a pawn to the last row of the board, he replaces the pawn by a queen,
rook, knight, or bishop (of the same color). Usually, players will promote
the pawn to a queen, but the other types of pieces are also allowed. (It
is not required that the pawn is promoted to a piece taken. Thus, it is
for instance possible that a player has at a certain moment two queens.)</P>
