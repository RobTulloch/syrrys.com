<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Chess</H1>

<P>Chess is a game, played by two players. One player plays with the white
pieces, and the other player plays with the black pieces. Each player has
sixteen pieces in the beginning of the game: one king, one queen, two rooks,
two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. </P>

<P>The game is played on a chessboard, consisting of 64 squares: eight
rows and eight columns. The squares are alternately light (white) and dark
colored. The board must be laid down such that there is a black square
in the lower-left corner. To facilitate notation of moves, all squares
are given a name. From the view of the white player, the rows are numbered
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8; the lowest row has number 1, and the upper row
has number 8. The columns are named, from left to right, a, b, c, d, e,
f, g, h. A square gets a name, consisting of the combination of its column-letter
and row-number, e.g., the square in the lower left corner (for white) is
a1. </P>

<P>Alternately, the players make a move, starting with the white player
(the player that plays with the white pieces.) A move consists of moving
one of the pieces of the player to a different square, following the rules
of movement for that piece - there is one special exception, named <B>castling</B>,
where players move two pieces simultaneously. </P>

<P>A player can <B>take</B> a piece of the opponent by moving one of his
own pieces to the square that contains a piece of the opponent. The opponents
piece then is removed from the board, and out of play for the rest of the
game. (Taking is not compulsory.) </P>

<P>At the start of the game, the position of the pieces is as follows.

<P>Thus, at the second row, there are eight white pawns, at the seventh
row, there are eight black pawns. At the first row, from left to right,
we have a: <A HREF="rook.htm">rook</A>, <A HREF="knight.htm">knight</A>,
<A HREF="bishop.htm">bishop</A>, <A HREF="queen.htm">queen</A>, <A HREF="king.htm">king</A>,
<A HREF="bishop.htm">bishop</A>,<A HREF="knight.htm"> knight</A>, and
<A HREF="rook.htm">rook</A>. </P>

<H2>Check, mate, and stalemate</H2>

<H3>Check</H3>

<P>When the king of a player can be taken by a piece of the opponent, one
says that the king is <I>in check</I>. For instance, the white player moves
his rook to a position such that it attacks the black king, i.e., if black
doesn't do anything about it, the rook could take the black king in the
next move: we say that the white rook <I>gives check.</I> It is considered
good manners to say <I>check</I> when one checks ones opponent. </P>

<P>It is not allowed to make a move, such that ones king is in check after
the move. If a player accidently tries to make such a move, he must take
the move back and make another move.</P>

<H3>Mate</H3>

<P>When a player is in check, and he cannot make a move such that after
the move, the king is not in check, then he is <I>mated</I>. The player
that is mated lost the game, and the player that mated him won the game.
</P>

<P>Note that there are three different possible ways to remove a check:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>Move the king away to a square where he is not in check. </LI>

<LI>Take the piece that gives the check. </LI>

<LI>(In case of a check, given by a rook, bishop or queen: ) move a piece
between the checking piece and the king. </LI>
</OL>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="mate.gif" HEIGHT=235 WIDTH=235> </P></CENTER>

<H3>Stalemate</H3>

<P>When a player cannot make any legal move, but he is not in check, then
the player is said to be <I>stalemated</I>. In a case of a stalemate, the
game is a draw. </P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="stalemat.gif" HEIGHT=235 WIDTH=235> <BR>
When black must move, the game is a stalemate </P></CENTER>
