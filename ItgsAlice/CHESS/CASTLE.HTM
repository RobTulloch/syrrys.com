<H3>Castling</H3>

<P>Under certain, special rules, a king and rook can move simultaneously
in a <I>castling</I> move. </P>

<P>The following conditions must be met: </P>

<UL>
<LI>The king that makes the castling move has not yet moved in the game.
</LI>

<LI>The rook that makes the castling move has not yet moved in the game.
</LI>

<LI>The king is not in check. </LI>

<LI>The king does not move over a square that is attacked by an enemy piece
during the castling move. </LI>

<LI>The king does not move to a square that is attacked by an enemy piece
during the castling move. </LI>

<LI>All squares between the rook and king before the castling move are
empty. </LI>
</UL>

<P>When castling, the king moves two squares towards the rook, and the
rook moves over the king to the next square, i.e., white's king on e1 and
rook on a1 move to: king c1, rook d1 (<I>long castling</I>), white's king
on e1 and rook on h1 move to: king g1, rook f1 (<I>short castling</I>),
and similar for black. </P>
