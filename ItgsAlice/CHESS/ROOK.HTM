<H3>The<TT> </TT>Rook</H3>

<P>The rook moves in a straight line, horizontally or vertically. The rook
may not jump over other pieces, that is: all squares between the square
where the rook starts its move and where the rook ends its move must be
empty. (As for all pieces, when the square where the rook ends his move
contains a piece of the opponent, then this piece is taken. The square
where the rook ends his move may not contain a piece of the player owning
this rook.) </P>
