<P>The next moment soldiers came running through the wood, at first in
twos and threes, then ten or twenty together, and at last in such crowds
that they seemed to fill the whole forest. <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Alice</FONT>
got behind a <A HREF="images/tree.gif">tree</A>, for fear of being
run over, and watched them go by.</P>

<P>The thought that in all her life she had never seen soldiers so uncertain
on their <A HREF="misc/mercury.htm">feet</A>: they were always tripping
over something or other, and whenever one went down, several more always
fell over him, so that the ground was soon covered with little heaps of
men.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/Knights.jpg" HSPACE=3 VSPACE=3 BORDER=2 HEIGHT=486 WIDTH=400 ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<P>Then came the horses. Having four <A HREF="misc/mercury.htm">feet</A>,
these managed rather better than the <A HREF="misc/mercury.htm">foot-</A>soldiers:
but even <I>they</I> stumbled now and then; and it seemed to be a regular
rule that, whenever a horse stumbled the rider fell off instantly. The
confusion got worse every moment, and <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Alice</FONT>
was very glad to get out of the wood into an open place, where she found
the<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"> <A HREF="chess/king.htm">white king</A> </FONT>seated
on the ground, busily writing in his memorandum-book.</P>

<P><EMBED SRC="sounds/1.wav" width=144 height=60><A HREF="info/note1.htm">(game)</A></P>

<P>All this was lost on <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Alice</FONT>, who was still
looking intently along the road, shading her eyes with one hand. <EMBED SRC="sounds/2.wav" width=144 height=60></P>

<P>(For the <A HREF="misc/mercury.htm">messenger</A> kept <A HREF="info/note2.htm">skipping
up and down</A>, and wriggling like an eel, as he came along, with his
great hands spread out like fans on each side.)</P>

<P><EMBED SRC="sounds/3.wav" width=144 height=60><A HREF="info/note3.htm">(Haiga)</A></P>

<P>At this moment the <A HREF="misc/mercury.htm">messenger</A> arrived:
he was far too much out of breath to say a word, and could only wave his
hands about, and make the most fearful faces at the poor <FONT COLOR="#000000"><A HREF="chess/king.htm">king</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><EMBED SRC="sounds/4.wav" width=144 height=60><A HREF="info/note4.htm">(I
love)</A>, the <A HREF="chess/king.htm">king</A> said, introducing <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Alice</FONT>
in the hope of turning off the <A HREF="misc/mercury.htm">messenger's</A>
attention from himself--but it was no use--the Anglo-Saxon attitudes only
got more extraordinary every moment, while the great eyes rolled wildly
from side to side.</P>

<P><EMBED SRC="sounds/5.wav" width=144 height=60></P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/Sandwich.jpg" HSPACE=3 VSPACE=3 BORDER=2 HEIGHT=204 WIDTH=249 ALIGN=RIGHT></P>

<P>On which the <A HREF="misc/mercury.htm">messenger</A>, to Alice's
great amusement, opened a bag that hung round his neck, and handed a sandwich
to the <A HREF="chess/king.htm">king</A>, who devoured it greedily.</P>

<P><EMBED SRC="sounds/6.wav" width=144 height=60><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Alice</FONT>
was glad to see that it revived him a good deal. </P>

<P><EMBED SRC="sounds/7.wav" width=144 height=60>Which <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Alice</FONT>
did not <A HREF="info/note5.htm">venture to deny.</A></P>

<P><EMBED SRC="sounds/8.wav" width=144 height=60>the <A HREF="chess/king.htm">king</A>
went on, holding out his hand to the <A HREF="misc/mercury.htm">messenger</A>
for some more hay.</P>

<P><EMBED SRC="sounds/9.wav" width=144 height=60>said the <A HREF="misc/mercury.htm">messenger</A>,
putting his hands to his mouth in the shape of a trumpet, and stooping
so as to get close to the <A HREF="chess/king.htm">king's</A> ear. <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Alice</FONT>
was sorry for this, as she wanted to hear the news too. However, instead
of whispering, he simply shouted at the top of his voice </P>

<P><EMBED SRC="sounds/10.wav" width=144 height=60>And they trotted off,
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Alice</FONT> repeating to herself, as she ran, the
words of the <A HREF="info/note6.htm">old song</A>:--</P>

<CENTER><P>`The <FONT COLOR="#008000">Lion</FONT> and the <FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Unicorn</FONT>
were fighting for the crown:<BR>
The <FONT COLOR="#008000">Lion</FONT> beat the <FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Unicorn</FONT>
all round the town.<BR>
Some gave them white bread, some gave them brown;<BR>
Some gave them plum-cake and drummed them out of town.'<BR>
<BR>
</P></CENTER>

<P><EMBED SRC="sounds/11.wav" width=144 height=60><EMBED SRC="sounds/12.wav" width=144 height=60></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Alice</FONT> had no more breath for talking, so
they trotted on in silence, till they came in sight of a great crowd, in
the middle of which the <FONT COLOR="#008000">Lion</FONT> and <FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Unicorn</FONT>
were fighting. They were in such a cloud of dust, that at first <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Alice</FONT>
could not make out which was which: but she soon managed to distinguish
the <FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Unicorn</FONT> by his horn.</P>

<P>They placed themselves close to where Hatta, the other <A HREF="misc/mercury.htm">messenger</A>,
was standing watching the fight, with a cup of tea in one hand and a piece
of bread-and-butter in the other.</P>

<P><EMBED SRC="sounds/13.wav" width=144 height=60>,he went on, putting
his arm affectionately round Hatta's neck.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/cTea.jpg" HSPACE=3 VSPACE=3 BORDER=2 HEIGHT=207 WIDTH=256 ALIGN=LEFT>Hatta
looked round and nodded, and went on with his bread and butter.<EMBED SRC="sounds/14.wav" width=144 height=60>Hatta
looked round once more, and this time a tear or two trickled down his cheek:
but not a word would he say.</P>

<P><EMBED SRC="sounds/15.wav" width=144 height=60></P>

<P>There was a pause in the fight just then, and the <FONT COLOR="#008000">Lion</FONT>
and the <FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Unicorn</FONT> sat down, panting, while the
<A HREF="chess/king.htm">king</A> called out <EMBED SRC="sounds/16.wav" width=144 height=60>Haigha
and Hatta set to work at once, carrying rough trays of white and brown
bread. <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Alice</FONT> took a piece to taste, but it
was <B>very</B> dry.</P>

<P><EMBED SRC="sounds/17.wav" width=144 height=60>And Hatta went bounding
away like a grasshopper.</P>

<P>For a minute or two <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Alice</FONT> stood silent,
watching him. Suddenly she brightened up. <EMBED SRC="sounds/18.wav" width=144 height=60></P>

<P>At this moment the <FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Unicorn</FONT> sauntered by
them, with his hands in his pockets. <EMBED SRC="sounds/19.wav" width=144 height=60>and
he was going on, when his eye happened to fall upon <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Alice</FONT>:
he turned round rather instantly, and stood for some time <FONT COLOR="#000000">loo</FONT>king
at her with an air of the deepest disgust.</P>

<P><EMBED SRC="sounds/20.wav" width=144 height=60>Haigha replied eagerly,
coming in front of <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Alice</FONT> to introduce her,
and spreading out both his hands towards her in an Anglo-Saxon attitude.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Alice</FONT> could not help her lips curling up
into a smile as she began: <EMBED SRC="sounds/21.wav" width=144 height=60></P>

<P>`Well, now that we <I>have</I> seen each other,' said the <FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Unicorn</FONT>,
`if you'll believe in me, I'll believe in you. Is that a bargain?'</P>

<P><EMBED SRC="sounds/23.wav" width=144 height=60></P>

<P>`Come, fetch out the plum-cake, old man!' the <FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Unicorn</FONT>
went on, turning from her to the king. `None of your brown bread for me!'</P>

<P><EMBED SRC="sounds/25.wav" width=144 height=60></P>

<P>Haigha took a large cake out of the bag, and gave it to <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Alice</FONT>
to hold, while he got out a dish and carving-knife. How they all came out
of it <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Alice</FONT> couldn't guess. It was just like
a conjuring-trick, she thought.</P>

<P>The <FONT COLOR="#008000">Lion</FONT> had joined them while this was
going on: he looked very tired and sleepy, and his eyes were half shut.
<EMBED SRC="sounds/26.wav" width=144 height=60></P>

<P>The king was evidently very uncomfortable at having to sit down between
the two great creatures; but there was no other place for him.</P>

<P><EMBED SRC="sounds/27.wav" width=144 height=60>,the <FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Unicorn</FONT>
said, looking slyly up at the crown, which the poor <A HREF="chess/king.htm">king</A>
was nearly shaking off his head, he trembled so much.</P>

<P><EMBED SRC="sounds/28.wav" width=144 height=60></P>

<P>Here the king interrupted, to prevent the quarrel going on: he was very
nervous, and his voice quite quivered. <EMBED SRC="sounds/29.wav" width=144 height=60></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Alice</FONT> had seated herself on the bank of
a little brook, with the great dish on her knees, and was sawing away diligently
with the knife. <EMBED SRC="sounds/30.wav" width=144 height=60>she said,
in reply to the <FONT COLOR="#008000">Lion</FONT> (she was getting quite
used to being called `the Monster'). <EMBED SRC="sounds/31.wav" width=144 height=60></P>

<P>This sounded nonsense, but <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Alice</FONT> very obediently
got up, and carried the dish round, and the cake divided itself into three
pieces as she did so. <EMBED SRC="sounds/32.wav" width=144 height=60></P>

<P>But before <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Alice</FONT> could answer him, the
drums began.</P>

<P>Where the noise came from, she couldn't make out: the air seemed full
of it, and it rang through and through her head till she felt quite deafened.
She started to her <A HREF="misc/mercury.htm">feet</A> and sprang
across the little brook in her terror,</P>

and had just time to see the <FONT COLOR="#008000">Lion</FONT> and the
<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Unicorn</FONT> rise to their <A HREF="misc/mercury.htm">feet</A>,with
angry looks at being interrupted in their feast, before she dropped to
her knees, and put her hands over her ears, vainly trying to shut out the
dreadful uproar.</P></CENTER>
